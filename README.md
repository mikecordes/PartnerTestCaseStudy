Mr. Lu learned about blockchain technology. In the same year that he learned about the technology, he co-founded a company called BitSE. This is the company that lead to the creation of the VeChain blockchain.

It started as a subsidiary of Bitse, one of China’s largest blockchain companies, and is among the few blockchains that already have a substantial customer base among established companies.  VeChain’s development roots can be traced to the acquaintance of Sunny and Vitalik Buterin (Founder of the Ethereum Blockchain) through the Founder of Fenbushi Capital, Shen Bo in late 2015. The discussion between the two led to Sunny’s realization of the innovativeness and practicality of smart contract technology. At the beginning of the venture, VeChain built its own permissioned blockchain based on the architecture of Ethereum. Later on, VeChain landed its first client from the luxury industry where Sunny used to work.
